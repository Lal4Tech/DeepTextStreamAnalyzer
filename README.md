# Text Stream Analysis

Extracting valid, novel, useful/actionable, understandable information from large amount of data is always having significance in various domains. The data can come from various sources, can have various forms, structured or unstructured and can be either static or stream. Collecting, storing, pre-processing, analyzing and communicating the results bring lot of challenges. It’s observed that the methods used at each stages of processing vary based on the behaviour of data. 

In this project we analyze stream of text data. We provide emphasis for both pre processing and analysis stage. Also, possibly implement visualization showcasing different statistics and analysis results.
